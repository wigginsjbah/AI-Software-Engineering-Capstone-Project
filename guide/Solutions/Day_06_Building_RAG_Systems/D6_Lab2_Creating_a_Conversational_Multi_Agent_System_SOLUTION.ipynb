    "**Objective:** Integrate the multi-agent LangGraph system from the previous lab into the FastAPI backend, creating a new `/chat` endpoint that is stateful and can handle conversational memory.\n",

    "This solution notebook provides the complete code for deploying the LangGraph agent as a conversational API. It covers creating a stateless endpoint, building a Streamlit UI, and finally implementing stateful memory management.\n",

This allows us to develop the API and UI without needing to run the full, complex graph. In a real application, you would import your compiled graph object here."

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This code block contains the complete, final version of the backend code to be added to `app/main.py`. It includes both the stateless and stateful endpoints for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`StatefulChatRequest`**: The request model is updated to include an optional `session_id`.\n",
    "2.  **Endpoint Logic**: The stateful endpoint checks if a `session_id` was provided. If not, it creates a new one, establishing a new conversation session.\n",
    "3.  **`config` object**: This is the most critical part. We pass a `config` dictionary to the `.invoke()` method. LangGraph specifically looks for the `{\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"...\"}}` structure to manage memory. When it sees this, it automatically retrieves the history for that session, includes it in the context for the LLM, and saves the new turn to that same history."

    "Excellent! You have successfully integrated your powerful multi-agent system into a real-world application. You created a stateless API endpoint, built a UI for it, and then performed the critical upgrade to make it a stateful, conversational agent with memory. This is the complete pattern for deploying sophisticated AI assistants that can engage in natural, multi-turn dialogues with users.\n",
